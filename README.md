# DockerizedWebServer
Project made to refresh myself on docker and socket programing in Java.

## Objective
Webserver hosted in a docker container. Sends a sample webpage to the client.

## Running
To run the server you will need to have docker and docker-compose installed.

Once instaled simply run `docker-compose up -d` to get things up and going.
